First visited by [[Ruth]] and [[Keith]] after the group arrived in Lawton. The clinic appears to be run by [[Dr. Caine]] and his [[Nurse]].  There were a lot of people there with [[Bug Bites]], as there was the presence of a [[Strange Smell]]. People who had visited prior to the two had gone missing, and [[Ruth]] overhead the doctor and nurse preparing the use of a sedative. It was at this point they left.
